**Ultimate Tech Stack for Ephemeral WiFi Chat App**

---

### **Frontend:**

- **Framework:** **Flutter**
  - **Reason:** Flutter allows for rapid development and provides a native performance on both iOS and Android platforms. It offers a rich set of customizable widgets, and its reactive framework is ideal for building dynamic UI elements necessary in a chat application.
  
### **Backend:**

- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** **Firebase**
  - **Services Used:**
    - **Firebase Authentication:** Simplifies the authentication process.
    - **Cloud Firestore:** A NoSQL document database that scales automatically and offers real-time data synchronization.
    - **Cloud Functions:** Serverless backend code execution, useful for message deletion logic.
  - **Reason:** Firebase provides real-time database capabilities, seamless integration with Flutter, and built-in support for user authentication and cloud functions. This reduces the need to manage your own servers and backend infrastructure.

### **Database:**

- **Database:** **Cloud Firestore (part of Firebase)**
  - **Reason:** Cloud Firestore offers real-time synchronization, offline support, and built-in TTL (Time to Live) functionality using Cloud Functions to automate message deletion after 24 hours.

### **Additional Services:**

- **State Management:** **Provider** or **Bloc Pattern** (for Flutter)
- **Encryption:** **End-to-End Encryption Libraries** (e.g., `encrypt` package in Dart)
- **Push Notifications (Future Enhancement):** **Firebase Cloud Messaging**

## **Step-by-Step Development Guide**

### **Phase 1: Research & Initial Setup**

#### **Milestone 1: Setup Development Environment**

1. **Install Flutter SDK:**
   - Download and install Flutter from the official website.
   - Set up environment variables and add Flutter to your system path.
2. **Set Up IDE:**
   - Use **Visual Studio Code** or **Android Studio** with Flutter and Dart plugins.
3. **Create a New Flutter Project:**
   - Run `flutter create ephemeral_wifi_chat` in your terminal.

#### **Milestone 2: Integrate Firebase into Your Flutter App**

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. **Register Your App with Firebase:**
   - For both Android and iOS, register your app in the Firebase project settings.
3. **Add Firebase Configuration Files:**
   - **Android:** Add `google-services.json` to `android/app/`.
   - **iOS:** Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner/`.
4. **Add Firebase Dependencies:**
   - Update `pubspec.yaml` with Firebase packages:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       firebase_core: ^1.10.6
       cloud_firestore: ^3.1.10
       firebase_auth: ^3.3.10
       # Add other necessary packages
     ```
5. **Initialize Firebase in Your App:**
   - In `main.dart`, initialize Firebase before `runApp()`.

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality**

#### **Milestone 3: WiFi Connection Detection**

1. **Add Connectivity Package:**
   - Add `connectivity_plus` to `pubspec.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       connectivity_plus: ^2.2.1
     ```
2. **Implement WiFi Detection Logic:**
   - Use `Connectivity().getWifiName()` and `Connectivity().getWifiBSSID()` to retrieve WiFi information.
   - Create a service to monitor connectivity changes.
3. **Restrict Access Based on WiFi Connection:**
   - Check if the user is connected to a WiFi network.
   - Store the SSID/BSSID in the app state for later use.
   - If not connected to WiFi, display a message or restrict access to the chat feature.

#### **Milestone 4: User Authentication via WiFi**

1. **Anonymous Authentication with Firebase:**
   - Enable Anonymous Authentication in Firebase Console.
   - Use Firebase Auth to sign in users anonymously.
2. **Associate Users with Network:**
   - When a user signs in, store their WiFi SSID/BSSID in their user profile within the app.

#### **Milestone 5: Design Ephemeral Messaging System**

1. **Define Data Models:**
   - **Message Model:** Contains content, timestamp, user ID, and network identifier (SSID/BSSID hash).
2. **Implement Real-Time Database Structure:**
   - Set up Firestore collections:
     - `/networks/{networkId}/messages/{messageId}`
3. **Set Up Message Deletion Logic:**
   - Use Cloud Functions to trigger a delete operation 24 hours after message creation.
   - Sample Cloud Function in JavaScript:

     ```javascript
     exports.deleteOldMessages = functions.firestore
       .document('networks/{networkId}/messages/{messageId}')
       .onCreate((snapshot, context) => {
         const now = admin.firestore.Timestamp.now();
         const cutoff = now.toMillis() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
         const oldMessagesQuery = admin.firestore()
           .collection(`networks/${context.params.networkId}/messages`)
           .where('timestamp', '<=', cutoff);
         return oldMessagesQuery.get().then(snapshot => {
           const batch = admin.firestore().batch();
           snapshot.docs.forEach(doc => {
             batch.delete(doc.ref);
           });
           return batch.commit();
         });
       });
     ```

### **Phase 3: Real-Time Chat Interface**
